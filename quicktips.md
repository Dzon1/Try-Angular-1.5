### Emulate a Hosting Server

**Command** `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

**Assumes**:
    - you have [python](https://www.python.org/) installed globally
    - you're working in a folder with a valid `index.html` file

**What it does**: this command "emulates" a host server for your website on your local machine. The "simulated" web address is one of the following:

- [http://0.0.0.0:8000/](http://0.0.0.0:8000/)
- [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
- [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
